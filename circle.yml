    # Set the default python version. CircleCI uses pyenv, which also
    # appears to require a .python-version file mentioning this
    # version and a specific sub-version of any python versions we
    # test against.
    #
    # Note that circleci has many python versions preinstalled, but any
    # versions that are not preinstalled are built from source with no
    # caching on every build, so don't increase this version until
    # circleci has the new version preinstalled.
